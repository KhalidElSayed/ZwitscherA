Welcome to Zwitscher, a microblogging client for Android.
I know that this is not the first one and far from working good.
It is first a "real" project for me to get into Android programming.

Currently the client uses the twitter4j library, but I think in the
longer term, I will directly go to use REST/Json, as there is already
native Json support in the Android libraries
- this lets me learn that part
- it scales down the application size.

I did not really set a target Android platform - at the end
it has to work on my HTC Desire with Android 2.2.

===== ATTENTION ON HACKING THE SOURCE =========

As Twitter.com is not really ready to handle open source projects,
you need to register the app at Twitter and then provide a class
TwitterConsumerToken that looks like this with the values Twitter
provided you with put in:

package de.bsd.zwitscher;

public class TwitterConsumerToken {

	public static String consumerKey = "replaceWithKey";
	public static String consumerSecret = "replaceWithSecret";
	public static boolean xAuthEnabled = false;

}

To obtain this Token, go to http://twitter.com/apps and log in.
Then click on "Register an Application" and give some details.
When this is done you will end up on a page that lists application
details including consumerKey and consumerSecret.
As Twitter by default does not enable xAuth, the third parameter
needs to be set to false to go through the "normal" oAuth procedure of
logging in.

Zwitscher has meanwhile progressed enough to be available on the Android market.
For this version you don't need to obtain any tokens.
