Welcome to ZwitscherA, a microblogging client for Android.
I know that this is not the first one and far from working good.
It is first a "real" project for me to get into Andriod programming.

Currently the client uses the twitter4j library, but I think in the
longer term, I will directly go to use REST/Json, as there is alredy
native Json support in the Android libraries
- this lets me learn that part 
- it scales down the application size.

I did not really set a target Android platform - at the end
it has to work on my HTC Desire with Android 2.1.
